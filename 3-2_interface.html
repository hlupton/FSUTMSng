      <h3>Model Calibration and Validation</h3>
      <body>

        <p>In February 2022, the Model Task Force adopted the validation guidance prepared for FDOT as part of the process of developing standards for FSUTMS. This document provides some needed specificity on guidelines for model validation and includes the following elements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The preferred model validation process, including considerations and best practices, types of validation checks, the use of targets and guidelines, the development of a model validation plan, and validation of model input data</li>
          <li>The process of validating the demand components of trip based and activity based model</li>
          <li>The validation process for highway and transit assignment</li>
          <li>The process for temporal validation and sensitivity testing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The validation guidance document does not distinguish among guidance for different stakeholders, such as model
          developers, appliers, and reviewers. However, the NextGen technical team sees the value in providing specific guidance
           for each of these groups even though there is significant overlap in the guidance. Therefore, the summary of the
           validation guidelines is presented below for each group.</p>
        <p>It is important to recognize that while the list of checks should be performed in all applicable cases, numeric targets should be treated as guidelines, not standards. The points below can be treated as a checklist of tasks to perform, but numeric guidelines are not pass/fail tests of model validity. See the validation guidance document for more information.</p>

          <ul><li>Consider performing checks that may not have been done in the original validation.</li></ul>
          <li>If appropriate, perform additional sensitivity testing specific to the application for which the model is being used.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
